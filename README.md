# Mental Health Detection Using ML Algorithms
This project used data from social media networks to explore various methods of early detection of MHDs based on machine learning. We performed a thorough analysis of the dataset to characterize the subjectsâ€™ behavior based on different aspects of their PHQ9 question answering, textual inputs, Python code for Depression Detection using multiple machine learning algorithms and Twitter dataset for detecting depression also from sentiments
